                HON is incredibly proud of these competent and compassionate individuals. We feel fortunate that they are employed at HON. Here are some of the things our employees have to say:

                My list is endless of why I love working for HON. The compassion, challenges, support, love, environment, skills, and learning opportunities provided by working at HON are phenomenal. The self-gratification of helping a patient understand hospital billing, making a positive impact for the patient, or the ah ha moment in a representative that we are sharing our knowledge and expertise with is priceless and awarding in itself. The commodore, strive, and rallying of everyone within the company is truly striking. It is a pleasure to work with each and every patient to resolve accounts and listen to their story.  Working at HON, we improve skills we currently possess as well as incorporate/obtain a skill set that we can carry with us anywhere. The opportunities are limitless within the company to grow and there is always a new learning opportunity. We are provided the ability to independently incorporate our ideas to contribute to our company's success which is a highlight of HON. Tricia and Adam has created an environment that this is our company that includes support, growth, and love. The best part of working at HON is the family atmosphere provided by the company and coworkers we work alongside with.

                Integrity and Character, words that are easily spoken, yet hard to execute, particularly day-in and day-out over (20) years of HON&apos;s existence. In my years at HON, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to experience and contribute to the underlying notion of Integrity and Character. The results have spoken for themselves; 50% growth rate per annum in the time I&apos;ve been here, nearly 100% client retention, and integration of the latest technologies that channel the organization&apos;s core goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is  great satisfaction derived from deploying new technologies, like technology that allows seamless communication between us, our clients, and patients, and doing so in a more efficient, productive, and profitably manner than our peers in the industry.

                Knowing that I played a behind the scenes part in a patient who is satisfied with excellent customer service, these are the things that makes one do a high-five with his peers, and the organization.

                I love working for HON because I feel respected and valued for what I bring to the company. The flexibility to attend to family matters if necessary and the encouragement to come up with my own ideas and provide input to the team is very important to me. It&apos;s my home away from home. It&apos;s a family atmosphere. I have been working here for a long time and I am honored to still be a part of the HON Family after 11 years.

                In 2013 I had the honor to start working at Hon, since then I have learned a lot about Hospital billing. I started as a call representative, and then I was given the opportunity to be a Senior Representative and a team trainer. Hon focused on my strengths and promoted me to training supervisor.  I love that Hon gives you opportunities to move up within the company.

                Health Care Outsourcing is a great company to work. From my personal experience they give you great opportunity to expand your horizons. When I first started I was patient account representative and was given the opportunity to work on several different hospitals as well as learning their systems. Now I am a Client liaison representative, and learning new things daily I have been an employee with the company for seven years and my work experience with them has been wonderful. My co-workers as well as management are totally awesome. We have a great team. So working for Health Care Outsourcing has given me great opportunity and it's much appreciated. These are a few of the reasons why I work for HON.

I grew up with having principle in believing that your word is a bond, being honest and working very hard, I admire and respect the hard work you and Adam's have done in building this company. I have great expectations about this company and I want to be part of its success. I appreciate what life gives me and all opportunities, I honestly can say that working for his company is one of the best things I have and I feel I have to work hard for, to give back what it has given me.

                Over the years, I have come to know the kindness and humanity of the employers and as I call them (upper management) that has been shown to the employees. There are monetary rewards and benefits of working here but the humanity of it all, as shown when someone is in need outshines it all. When my son died, and I went through two operations on my right lower leg from a fall, I was given the time I needed to heal without worrying whether I would have a job when I came back. That meant a lot to me. I like the fact that children are allowed to come to work with moms, when it is needed. Not very many companies allow this. Tricia even though you are in charge of the employees and take care of problems as they arise whether work related or personality wise, I admire the fact that there is also a kindness and understanding about you. I like doing what I do here and being able to come to work every day to a comfortable and safe place to work is important. Basically what it comes down to is I like my job, I like the people I work with and I like the people I work for.
