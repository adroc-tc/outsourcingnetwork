                    Integrity and Character, words that are easily spoken, yet hard to execute, particularly day-in and day-out over (20) years of HON&apos;s existence. In my years at HON, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to experience and contribute to the underlying notion of Integrity and Character. The results have spoken for themselves; 50% growth rate per annum in the time I&apos;ve been here, nearly 100% client retention, and integration of the latest technologies that channel the organization&apos;s core goals.

When my son died, and I went through two operations on my right lower leg from a fall, I was given the time I needed to heal without worrying whether I would have a job when I came back. That meant a lot to me. I like the fact that children are allowed to come to work with moms, when it is needed. Not very many companies allow this.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    I really enjoy this company! I feel very welcomed and everyone here is very helpful. I can tell what kind of people you employ and the upper management, supervisors, and fellow co-workers have been nothing but helpful and very welcoming. I love that this is one of the few places I have worked that has no drama!

                  <p class="card-text">

                    Overall I feel so far that I made a great career choice. Not to mention the benefits offered at a good price I also appreciate the people around me in this office. I really have enjoyed this company and coming to work every day! I haven't felt that way in a while about a job or company!
